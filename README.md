# Job-Scheduling-Optimization
This project focuses on solving the Job Scheduling Problem in a workshop with multiple machines. Each job requires specific processing times on each machine. The goal is to implement two different algorithms to find an optimal or near-optimal production schedule. 
The project involves data initialization, algorithm development, performance measurement, and evaluation against an Integer Programming solution. The deliverables include a concise report and a file with all code and documentation.
